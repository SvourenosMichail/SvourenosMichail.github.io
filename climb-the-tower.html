        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Climb the Tower is a mobile game I developed and published on Google Play. It was developed in Gamemaker Studio 2 which 
            uses an object oriented language. I created this app to gain experience and a deeper understanding of how to structure an
            app. Within a 10-day timeframe I created the code, graphics and UI for this application.

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Dividing development into pieces</h1>
        <p>In order to create this app within the timeframe I split development into key parts:
            <ul>
                <li>Day 1: Plan out the general idea of the game. This includes: gameplay, aesthetic and goals.</li>
                <li>Day 2: Code a prototype.</li>
                <li>Day 3: Refine gameplay.</li>
                <li>Day 4: Design and program UI elements. This includes: main menu, options and buttons.</li>
                <li>Day 5: Design game graphics. This includes: backgrounds, characters and UI visuals.</li>
                <li>Day 6: Program characters and their different abilites.</li>
                <li>Day 7: Program different gamemodes and a shop where the player can unlock the characters.</li>
                <li>Day 8: Implement mobile advertisements with the Google Admob API.</li>
                <li>Day 9: Fix bugs and finalize project.</li>
                <li>Day 10: Publish the application on Google Play.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Following this list I had a plan and could use my time efficiently. </p>

        <h1>Rapid prototyping</h1>
        <p>During application developement it is vital to create a functioning prototype as early as possible. Sometimes an idea
            sounds good on paper but is flawed in practice. Building a quick prototype that showcases the basic functionalities of
            the app can help the developer recognise problems in the early stages.
        </p>
        <p>Climb the Tower is a game of infinite stairs. The user has to use 2 buttons to climb the Tower's platforms in order to 
            get a high score. The main challenge was to create a way to easily generate platforms for the player to climb. I achieved this 
            using a script that manages a list containing the 6 next platforms. The reason I chose the number 6 is because that is the amount 
            of platforms rendered on the screen. Every time the user presses a button to jump the list gets updated. The last platform gets 
            'poped' from the list and a new one is added on top. In order to randomize the position every platform is assigned either the number 1 or
            -1. This number defines if it would be on the left or right of the previous platform. This approach has several benefits:
            <ul>
                <li>By tracking only 6 platforms we do not have a problem with memory management. This is important as the game can technically go on forever.</li>
                <li>The platform list only has to track a single value: 1 or -1. This makes understanding the game state very simple.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <img src="images/climb the tower/climb_the_tower_1.png" alt="">
        <p>In the above image we can see the platforms aswell as a bronze coin. If the player reaches the coin he gains a point. After collecting 
            enough coins he can unlock new characters in the shop. To add coins I just had to update the information stored in platform list. Instead 
        of just storing the 1 or -1 value I also stored an additional value representing the reward on the platform.</p>

        <h1>Character Design</h1>
        <img src="images/climb the tower/the-goons.png" alt="">
        <p>These are some of the characters I designed. It is importand for the character to stand out in the game so the player can easily distinguish 
            their position in the game. Every character has a unique ability and animation. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Google Admob</h1>
        <p>The game uses Google Admob to serve advertisments and monetise the application. Interstitial ads are served every 4th time the player fails. 
            After every failed attempt the player is given the option to watch a rewarded ad that doubles the coins he collected. A Async event is called after 
            the ad is complete and the coins are added to his account.
