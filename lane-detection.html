        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>I have developed a program that utilizes OpenCV to detect road lanes. By leveraging computer vision techniques,
             my program can analyze images or video frames and identify the lane markings on the road surface. This technology plays a 
             crucial role in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. By accurately detecting road lanes, the 
             program assists in lane keeping, lane departure warning, and other intelligent features that enhance road safety. This functionality is 
             then combinded with the YOLOv5 neural network to detect cars and estimate their distance form the driver.

        <h1>Image Analysis</h1>
        <img src="images/lane-detection-post/lane_detection_base.jpg" alt="">
       
        <p>Lets take the above image as an example. Notable information about the image: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The image shows the drivers point of view.</li>
                <li>The car is on a road with two lanes.</li>
                <li>A car is approaching from the opposite lane.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>In the first step we will process the image to predict the lane edges.To achieve that we will use some of openCV's built in methods. 
            With <span>cv2.cvtColor</span> and <span>cv2.GaussianBlur</span> we convert the image to grayscale and then blur it to reduce noise. 
            Finally with <span>cv2.Canny(blur,50,150)</span> we mark the areas where the gradient is bigger than 50. <br>
            These steps essentially isolate the edges in the image. 
        </p>
        <img src="images/lane-detection-post/edges.png" alt="">
        <p> The image still contains a lot of information that is not needed. We have to isolate the part of the image where to road is located.</p>
        <img src="images/lane-detection-post/region of interest.png" alt="">
        <p>Looking at the image part we can locate a long line that represents the right side of the lane. The road in the image is old and the left line 
            separating the lanes is not visible. In the above exapmple it is rather easy for the human eye to detect the straight line representing the 
            right side of the road however a computer does not process visual data in the same way. 
        </p>
        <p>Using the <span>HoughLinesP</span> method we can get a list of all continous lines in the image aswell. By tweaking the function's parameters we 
        can set the minimum line length and the maximum gap allowed between two points for them to be considered a line. After getting the list of lines we can
        process them until we arrive at the lines most likely to represent the side of a lane. Some of those processing techiques include:
        <ul>
            <li>Comparing multiple smaller lines with the same angle to check if they belong to a bigger line.</li>
            <li>Discarding lines with too small or too high angles.</li>
            <li>Predicting the expected position of the left side of a lane based on the right (or the reverse).</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/lane-detection-post/lanes.png" alt="">
        <p>The above image shows the results of the predictions.</p>
        <h1>Combining lane detection with object detection using YOLOv5</h1>
        <p>
            Using a convolutional neural network such as the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) model we can predict the location of cars in the image. Using this information
            we can then estimate the car distance from the driver aswell as the lanes the detected cars are currently on.
