        <h1><i class="fa-brands fa-java" style="color: #ff004f;"></i><span> Java</span></h1>
        <p>I have a solid foundation in programming with Java and have gained valuable insights from working with this versatile language. 
            Java has equipped me with a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles, allowing me to design modular and reusable code. 
            Through Java, I have learned the importance of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in building robust and maintainable applications. 
            Additionally, Java's vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks has provided me with the tools to develop scalable and enterprise-grade solutions. 
            I have honed my skills in Java by designing and implementing various projects, mastering concepts such as multithreading, exception handling, and 
            database connectivity. The experience with Java has not only broadened my technical expertise but also fostered my appreciation for writing clean, 
            efficient, and reliable code.</p>

    <h1><i class="fa-brands fa-python" style="color: #ff004f;"></i><span> Python</span></h1>
    <p>Python has been a transformative language in my programming journey, providing me with a range of powerful tools and frameworks to tackle diverse 
        projects. Through Python, I have gained extensive experience in data analysis and machine learning as I completed my thesis on computer vision using Python. 
        The simplicity and readability of Python have allowed me to write clean and concise 
        code, enhancing my productivity and facilitating collaboration within teams. Additionally, Python's versatility extends beyond data science, 
        enabling me to develop web applications, automate tasks, and create scripts for various purposes. Examples include a bot to scrape data using the Reddit API and 
        task automation with Selenium.</p>

        <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-code" style="color: #ff004f;"></i><span> Web Development</span></h1>
        <p>Web development has been an exciting realm in my programming journey, where I have acquired comprehensive skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and 
            popular frameworks like React, Spring Boot, and Angular. With HTML and CSS, I have honed my ability to create visually appealing and responsive web 
            pages, ensuring seamless user experiences across devices. JavaScript has empowered me to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites, 
            from client-side scripting to asynchronous data handling. <br>        
            Throughout my web development journey, I have gained expertise in front-end and back-end technologies, understanding the importance of seamless 
            integration and smooth user experiences. I am adept at designing and implementing <span>RESTful APIs,</span> handling data securely, and optimizing website 
            performance. I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends and emerging technologies, ensuring that I deliver 
            modern and innovative solutions. <br>
            
            With my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and frameworks like React, Spring Boot, and Angular, I am well-equipped to develop dynamic 
            and robust web applications. I enjoy the collaborative nature of web development, working closely with designers, back-end developers, and 
            stakeholders to create engaging and functional digital experiences.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h1><span>C</span></h1>
        <p>
            C is a powerful and versatile programming language that I have gained significant proficiency in. With C, I have honed my skills in low-level 
            programming, system-level development, and optimizing code efficiency. From implementing data structures to creating high-performance algorithms, 
            C has provided me with the tools to build robust and scalable solutions. I particularly enjoyed using the memory manipulation capabilities of C to work
             closely with hardware devices and develop efficient systems. C remains a fundamental language in my programming toolkit, enabling me to tackle a
            wide range of projects with precision and control.
