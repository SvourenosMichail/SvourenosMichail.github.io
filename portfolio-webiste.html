    <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            I take great pleasure in programming and firmly believe that continuous improvement comes from putting one's knowledge into 
            practice and creating actual projects. This belief is what inspired me to develop my portfolio website entirely from scratch 
            using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By embarking on this project, I have not only been able to apply the programming concepts and 
            techniques I have learned but also deepen my understanding of web development.

            Creating a website from scratch has been an enriching experience as I have enjoyed the creative freedom of designing the layout, implementing responsive design for various 
            screen sizes, and crafting engaging user interfaces. Through hands-on coding, I have gained valuable insights into how HTML, CSS, and 
            JavaScript work together to bring a website to life.

            I firmly believe that practical application is key to growth as a programmer. By working on this portfolio website, I have not only 
            improved my technical abilities but also enhanced my project management skills. From setting goals and timelines to managing resources 
            and tracking progress, I have gained valuable experience in executing a project independently. Additionally this website serves as a platform that
            can display my passion aswell as projects I have worked on.
